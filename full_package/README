     Please follow the different guidelines you can find in the web for this.

  => Use the android app to remote control (see 'how-to-remote-control' for details
  
- For using the software, you need to configure your network to use it as DNS Server.
  For local use on the PC only, you just need to configure the DNS Server on your PC to 127.0.0.1! 
  You migtht even configure your router to use this as DNS Server. This would make your network "Ad Free".
